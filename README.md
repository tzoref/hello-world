GitHub intro for open-source projects

I am studying Digital Humanities at CUNY Graduate Center and have had some introduction to Python in courses in Computational Linguistics, Software Design, and Text Analysis. I've used GitHub just by following specific instructions, and I'd like to understand a bit more about how it works.  I'd like to contribute to open source projects, and this seems like a great way to start.  


# What I accomplished in the GitHub tutorial

Started and managed a new branch

Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub

Opened and merged a Pull Request
